# Order-Inventory-Microservice

This project implements two Spring Boot microservices communicating via REST:
- **Inventory Service** — manages batches & stock
- **Order Service** — places orders & updates inventory


Both services use H2 DB, Spring JPA, Factory Pattern, and JUnit tests.
Mainly focused on logic not in imports and project setup
